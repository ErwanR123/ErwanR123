### üß† **2. Sentiment Analysis with Kernel PCA**

- **Objective**: Evaluate the impact of Kernel PCA (cosine kernel) on the performance of sentiment classification models using IMDb movie reviews.
- **Details**:  
  - Preprocessed text data using tokenization, POS-tagging, lemmatization, and stopword removal (NLTK).
  - Vectorized reviews using Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer with 10000 features).
  - Applied non-linear dimensionality reduction via Kernel PCA (cosine kernel, 1000 components).
  - Trained and compared multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN (with and without Kernel PCA).
  - Built an interactive CLI to test sentiment prediction on custom user input.
- **Result**: Kernel PCA significantly improved KNN performance, and slightly enhanced Logistic Regression and SVM.
- **Skills Used**:NLP (NLTK), Dimensionality Reduction (Kernel PCA), Text Classification, Scikit-learn, Data Visualization, Model Evaluation.
