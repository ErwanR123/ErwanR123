## üìö My Projects

### 1. **Cat vs Dog Image Classification**

- **Objective**: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs.
- **Details**:
  - Designed a custom CNN with Batch Normalization, Dropout, and L2 Regularization.
  - Preprocessing steps included resizing images to 128x128 pixels, cleaning corrupted images, and normalizing pixel values.
  - **Deployment**: Interactive Streamlit interface for real-time image classification.
  - **Result**: Achieved ~87% validation accuracy with precision of 0.81 and recall of 0.79.
- **Skills Used**: Data cleaning, deep learning, model evaluation, Streamlit.

### 2. **Kernel PCA Analysis**

- **Objective**: Compare traditional PCA with Kernel PCA for nonlinear data relationships using synthetic datasets.
- **Details**:
  - Applied kernels like RBF, polynomial, and cosine to visualize transformations.
  - Calculated relative differences in pairwise distances between original and transformed spaces.
  - **Result**: Demonstrated the advantages of nonlinear kernels in capturing complex structures.
- **Skills Used**: Python, kernel methods, data visualization.

### 3. **Monte Carlo Methods Project**

- **Objective**: Explore Monte Carlo simulation techniques for statistical estimation and probability analysis.
- **Details**:
  - Implemented advanced Monte Carlo methods such as inverse CDF sampling, acceptance-rejection, stratified sampling, importance sampling, and control variates.
  - Employed variance reduction strategies including:
    - **Control Variates Method**: Used a correlated score function for optimal bias correction.
    - **Importance Sampling**: Leveraged a non-Gaussian-weighted mixture of distributions for rare event probability estimation.
    - **Stratified Accept-Reject Method**: Enhanced sampling efficiency by partitioning and optimizing within strata. 
  - Visualized convergence of empirical estimates to theoretical distributions and computed confidence intervals.

**Result**: Demonstrated improved efficiency and accuracy in estimating probabilities and quantiles for complex distributions.

**Skills Used**: Stochastic simulation, R programming, variance reduction techniques, probability estimation.

### 4. **Portfolio Management Project**

- **Objective**: Analyze and optimize an investment portfolio by calculating the Tangent Portfolio and visualizing the Efficient Frontier.
- **Details**:
  - Collected historical data for indices like NASDAQ Composite and S&P 500 using `yfinance`.
  - Calculated Sharpe ratios, annualized returns, and volatilities.
  - Plotted the Efficient Frontier.
  - **Result**: Identified the optimal Tangent Portfolio with maximum Sharpe ratio.
- **Skills Used**: Financial analysis, portfolio optimization, data visualization (matplotlib).
