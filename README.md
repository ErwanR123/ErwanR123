### üß† 3. Sentiment Analysis with Kernel PCA

- **Objective**: Evaluate whether Kernel PCA (cosine kernel) can enhance the performance of standard classifiers in a binary sentiment classification task on IMDb reviews.
- **Approach**:  
  - Applied a complete NLP preprocessing pipeline: lowercasing, lemmatization with POS-tagging, stopword removal.  
  - Converted text into numerical features using Bag-of-Words (`CountVectorizer`) with a fixed vocabulary size.  
  - Reduced dimensionality using Kernel PCA (cosine kernel), and compared with both classical PCA and no reduction.  
  - Trained and evaluated three classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM (RBF kernel), and K-Nearest Neighbors.  
  - Analyzed how performance varies depending on the number of components used in Kernel PCA.
- **Findings**:  
  - Kernel PCA significantly improved KNN classification performance.  
  - Logistic Regression and SVM showed minor but consistent improvements with Kernel PCA over PCA.  
  - An optimal number of components was identified to retain over 90% of the explained variance with the cosine kernel.
- **Skills Used**: NLP (NLTK), Text Vectorization, Dimensionality Reduction (Kernel PCA), Scikit-learn, Model Evaluation, Experimental Design

### üß™ **4. Breast Cancer Classification (Statistical Learning Project)**

- **Objective**: Predict breast cancer presence based on clinical biomarkers from the Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset.
- **Details**:
  - Performed detailed **exploratory data analysis**: histograms, boxplots, scatter matrices, and correlation matrices.
  - Applied **log transformation** to right-skewed variables (`Insulin`, `HOMA`, `MCP.1`, `Resistin`) to improve normality and reduce outliers.
  - Standardized all features before model training to ensure fair comparison across algorithms.
  - Built and evaluated several models:
    - **Logistic Regression** (baseline and L2-regularized with `GridSearchCV`),
    - **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**,
    - **Na√Øve Bayes**,
    - **MLP Classifier**.
  - Used **stratified train/test split** and **5-fold cross-validation** for robustness.
  - Evaluation metrics included **F1-score**, **recall**, **AUC**, **ROC curves**, and **coefficient analysis**.
- **Results**:
  - Logistic regression with L2 regularization (`C=100`) achieved an **F1-score of 0.75**, with balanced recall across classes.
  - MLP and KNN provided comparable performance, suggesting that **nonlinear methods** could enhance predictive power.
- **Bonus**:
  - Initial SVM experiments included (`svm.ipynb`), but not detailed in the final report.
- **Skills Used**: Scikit-learn, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning, ROC Analysis.

### üö≤ **5. Bike-Sharing Demand Analysis**  
- **Objective**: Forecast urban bike-sharing demand using Generalized Linear Models (GLM).  
- **Details**:  
  - Explored dataset with **1,817 observations and 13 variables** (weather, time, season, etc.).  
  - Used **Box-Cox transformations** and feature selection (**AIC, BIC**).  
  - **Incorporated interaction effects** (e.g., time √ó season) for better accuracy.  
- **Result**: Achieved an **MSE of 217.84**, providing insights for operational decision-making.  
- **Skills Used**: R, GLMs, Predictive Analytics, Data Visualization.
