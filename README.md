## üìö My Projects

### 1. **Cat vs Dog Image Classification**

- **Objective**: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify images of cats and dogs.
- **Details**:
  - The architecture utilized essential layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, and BatchNormalization.
  - Preprocessed a dataset of ~20,000 images by cleaning corrupted files, resizing, and normalizing pixel values for optimal
model performance.
  - **Deployment**: Interactive Streamlit interface for real-time image classification.
  - **Result**: Achieved ~87% validation accuracy with precision of 0.81 and recall of 0.79.
- **Skills Used**: Deep Learning, CNN Architecture Design, Data Cleaning, Streamlit, TensorFlow Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib.
